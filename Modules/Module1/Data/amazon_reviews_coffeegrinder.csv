"4.0 out of 5 stars","Very slow.  My kettle boils before I can finish grinding one canister for the French press, using a drill on low speed at home.  I bought it for camping, takes about 10 minutes to grind enough coarse ground for a camping kettle. Does the job and is very compact."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","The design seems flawed, in that the cone isn't held in perfect concentricy with the cup, therefore  creating a grind that's comprised of varying ground sizes. Every time. Would not buy it again, even after having a replacement sent to me. The folks at the company were great to deal with, but I have to wonder if they don't  realize they have a dog on their hands."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Hey there Folks! So I just wanna state my qualifications:1) I am not a coffee Snob2) I drink coffee like a white gurl3) You'd be surprised to know I don't actually have a clue what good coffee is.What I do know, though, is that this grinder does the Job!! I use Black Rifle Coffee Company Coffee and I love doing a medium-coarse grind to compliment my French press and really extract flavors.A few tips with this grinder:1) Try different grinds to dial in what YOU like. I can't be the definition of what someone would enjoy or not enjoy2) When using a French press make sure its at least larger than a medium grind and to give you an idea 18 clicks out is Coarse, 9 clicks out from being completely tightened is Medium and so on.3) Cleaning this with a clean and DRY brush is super easy and fast and I've had 0 issues. Personally I barely clean it. Maybe clean it every 2 weeks unless you're OCD.4) Field use is good for it. I have used this as a comfort item while I'm in the field and it's been in the front of my pack when I jump out of planes on operations. It can take the abuse5) When grinding slow and even strokes work best. If you bounce the grinder around it will not grind evenly and you'll get a larger grind size than you want.In closing I'd say the only con is the bottom part that catches the coffee doesn't stay on well and I actually attached a Velcro cord on it that attaches to the bottom to the coffee catchers so it doesn't have to be held closed while coffee is being ground. I do also have to say it takes about 4 minutes for a medium course grind. You won't need a shake weight if you use this thing every day."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","I've always HEARD there was a difference with this kind of grind, and doing only what you truly need for that cup to be served within 15 minutes...but I can confirm it is a true statement!  Beans are heated up with the electric grinder (and the clean-up is almost as time-consuming anyway).  This gives me a ritual I am starting to really enjoy - either take the time to make the coffee, or forget it!  :)  The actual burr/grinder seems to be working quite well.  I've tried a very small grind, as well as a medium for my aeropress.  Adjusting the knob is not an exact science - it's done by screwing the knob tighter or loosening, but works well.  I'm looking forward to taking this with me when I travel!  Take this and an aero press, and you're SET in my book!  :)I've timed myself start to finish, water in kettle, measure beans, grind, pour, rinse the grinder with hot water and set on the drying mat to air dry for next day, and then press the coffee.  Takes about 10 minutes for me start to finish.  Reminds me to slow down...  :)"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","I love this item. I am getting into grinding my own coffee & have been looking for a burr grinder forever. I wanted an electric one initially, but I didn't want to spend $100 bucks for a decent one, & I don't want something that will take up valuable real estate on my counter. This item fits the bill nicely. This grinder is adjustable & takes a little messing around to find your preferred setting, but once you find it, you'll know. The only issue I have had, is when using different flavored coffees, the flavor can sometimes get trapped. I spoke with my coffee guru who recommended taking some dry rice & grinding it through. This trick works well & also helps to clean the grinder as well. The only issue/concern I have is that I have never owned a different grinder, so I cannot comment on it's quality/skill versus other grinders. All I can say is that this fits my needs perfectly, works well for my purpose, & is very reasonably priced. I have used this item multiple times daily for over 40 days without any issues."
"2.0 out of 5 stars","The grinder is very compact and is a perfect size for traveling.  It can only hold enough beans to grind for a single cup for pour-over or drip coffee machines.  With this grinder, the ability to ''dial in' your grind size is very convenient and helpful.  However, due to the nature of the ceramic burr and the drive shaft being loose, grind consistency is lacking.  In addition, after 6 months of regular use (used every morning, cleaned every month) two of the plastic pieces in the drive shaft broke causing a clicking sound when grinding and eventually rendering the grinder ineffective and unusable.  I would not recommend this grinder for long term use but for travel/occasional usage, as it is not designed for durability in everyday repeated work.Update: I was shipped a replacement grinder with updated parts in December 2017. The grinder worked well until May 2018 and has the same issues as listed above. Plastic pieces inside the grinder break and cause the crank shaft to wobble and the ceramic burr will no longer grind consistently (range of sizes in ground varies greatly). I stand by my initial assessment, as this grinder cannot handle everyday use for more than 6 months at a time. If you make your own coffee everyday like I do, I would suggest spending more money for a better manual grinder that can take the pressure."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","Pretty solid, however, settings seemed to be skewed to the coarse vs. fine side in regard to the setting of the grind. Also the handle is clearly made of a different material than the stainless steel body and you have to be careful not to get it wet because mine rusted after one day of air drying by the sink - UPDATE THE INTERNAL MECHANISM BROKE DOWN IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS THIS PRODUCT IS CHEAP AND DOES NOT HOLD UP"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","great little grinder but after 6 months the plastic piece inside the ceramic part broke. I hope I can buy this replacement part."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","I was so excited to receive this as I've seen such glowing reviews for the Javapresse all over the net, not just on Amazon.After a few minutes of the entire assembly turning when I tried to adjust the grind, it stopped and I finally got it to the number 7 setting for my MokaPot.  The grind came out beautifully even but it took me about 15 minutes just to grind the beans for one cup of coffee!  I don't have the time to do this for every cup!  Then I decided to try to change the grind coarser for a french press.  I can't even change the setting now because the whole grinding assembly turns and I can't adjust the coarseness.  This thing only lasted for one very expensive cup of coffee.  This is junk! RIPOFF! DO NOT BUY!"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","About 4 months ago, my wife bought us an espresso maker for our anniversary.  After seeing prices upwards of $100 for every electric burr grinder out there, we decided to go with this little guy instead.  Now, after having two of these grinders and making espressos every day (no that is not a joke, and yes, we like our coffee), there are four big takeaways:0) First off, this thing grinds quite well, which it should since that's is sole job (but see #2).  Espresso absolutely tastes noticeably different between this and an electric blade grinder.  If you want espresso, you need a non-blade grinder of some sort, for certain.1) This device is ...  SLOOOOOW ... at grinding espresso for two people.  It is quite fast if you want a French press (takes us about a minute), but if you want grinds small enough for several shots of espresso, be prepared to elbow grease it for 5-10 minutes.  While this is typically a non-issue (you simply grind while talking, or watching the news, etc.), we have days where 5-10 minute grind sessions are just not possible and others were it just seems like my time should be better spent elsewhere (like walking the dog, or helping my kids).  If you are a rush out the door type of morning person or have large family commitments, heads up!1A) My friend has an electric grinder; he makes us espresso every time we go over.  It takes about 5 minutes for four of us to have cups in hands.  My family visited, and it was a solid 20 minutes before four of us had an espresso in hand.  This is absolutely, without question, a personal use device only, at least for fine grounds.2) Customer service for this company is BEYOND PHENOMENAL.  Our first grinder just seemed off, but being espresso newbs we weren't quite sure.  After explaining how it was grinding, they instantly said ''nope, that's not supposed to happen'' and shipped us a new grinder express.  It was quick, it was polite, it was easy.  Great, great, great service.3) So the new grinder arrives, and as noted it grinds beautifully!  The problem: the bottom half of the grinder (the storage container) slips off quite easily, as in, if you don't hang onto it while grinding it falls off.  The fix was simple: just switch the bottom with our defective grinder.  Regardless, my experience at this point, coupled with the thousands of reviews saying just how great their costumer service is, leads me to believe that the company does not have a great quality control unit and instead relies on great customer service.  THAT IS FINE.  If you're going to treat people like kings and queens when we contact you with defects, by all means, use that as your business model.  This remains a buyer beware situation, but quite possibly the nicest one you will ever find yourself it.So why 4 stars?  Because after 4 months, I think the drawbacks are noticeable enough to call this a very good, but not great product.  People need to be aware that you will spend a good chunk of time and energy grinding, and probably spend time and energy making sure your product is actually up to standard.Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this, warts and all, based on the price and quality grinds.  Just don't kid yourself about the warts."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","I bought this just for brewing via French press which requires a coarse grind. I'm using click setting #16 (13-18 is for coarse grind). I might bring it down to maybe 15 or 14. I'm still playing around with it to see what works best. I'm able to get approximately about 5.5 tablespoons per grind. The general rule for French press is 1 tablespoon for 4 oz of water.The grind only took me 1 minute maybe coz I'm using a coarser grind setting, I was surprise how fast it took. I plan to drink 16-24 ounces per day of coffee.I thought it would take forever to grind, but it's great that it doesn't take long at all. It might take longer if you are using a finer grind setting, but I'm glad I don't have to deal with that.What I do is grind it the night before, so when I wake up at 5 am for work, all I gotta do is just heat up the water in the electric kettle, get dressed up, and then brew it after the water has heated"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","I had an electric coffee grinder for a couple of years, given to me by a friend.  While the electric grinder worked, it was not only bulky, taking up valuable countertop space, but also horribly loud; I try to be courteous to neighbors and so I was reluctant to run my coffee grinder first thing in the morning... when I needed it most.I saw that this JavaPresse Manual Coffee Grinder had good reviews on Amazon so I bought one.  It's very easy to see why it gets great reviews!First, this grinder is very small and compact.  If space is at a premium, then this is the coffee grinder for you.  Perhaps there is a smaller one out there, but I can't imagine there are too many that are a lot smaller.Second, the controls/adjustments are minimal: there is the grinding handle, the removable top for loading coffee beans, the removable bottom for emptying the grounds, and an inner adjustment dial for calibrating the size of your grind.Third, this coffee grinder just feels like a quality item.  Most of the parts are made of stainless steel, with minimal use of plastics and the actual grinding component made of ceramic.  There's nothing on it that I look at and think ''uh oh, I bet that's gonna break''.  Of course, only time will tell but I'm optimistic.Finally, the quantity of coffee that I can grind with this mill is just right for a cup of coffee.  That means that there's no excess to set aside (where it can dry out and lose flavor) or discard.  Perfect for someone who wants their morning cup and not an entire pot."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","I would not recommend this item. The grind is very inconsistent, especially at the medium - course settings. When grinding medium-course for Chemex, this produces a ton of fines. These fines over extract and add bitterness to every cup you brew. Today, half the grinds were medium course and the other half were fine! It clogged the filter and ruined the brew! If you're grinding more fine for Aeropress then this thing works okay, but truly you'd be better off saving your money, increasing your budget, and buying a much nicer grinder."
"2.0 out of 5 stars","This grinder is nice, but it isn't constructed to last. The handle is connected to a metal shaft that goes down to the ceramic burr. The ceramic burr has a hole in the center that the metal shaft connects to. It is secured to the shaft with a piece of plastic. The center plastic on mine broke and the shafts just spins, not turning the burr at all. However, when it did work It worked great. I was able to enjoy many of cups of fresh ground coffee because of it. I wouldn't recommend using it full time at home, but for a small simple grinder to take camping it would be fine."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","...so I'll share more as I learn more.  I watched the ''unboxing'' video recommended on the insert inside the box and was happy to see that I could start using the product right away without the wash in hot soapy water that is recommended for other items.  (I'll watch cleaning videos later on.)  First impressions: The packaging is gift-worthy. The device itself is beautiful, silver-colored brushed finish, length about 80% distance wrist to elbow, girth circle formed by middle finger and thumb, with a window to see how much coffee you've left to grind.The unboxing video explained that filling the container would make two cups of coffee.  Can confirm.  But did I hear the unboxing video say 1 cup of coffee beans would fit in the hopper? I don't know how much variation there is in coffee bean sizes but I could only fit 1/2 cup Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, and that's a LEVEL 1/2 cup.  And yes, even with the smaller 1/2 cup amount, one is likely to spill a bean or two while transferring the beans from measuring cup to hopper. Since even mild annoyances are magnified in the early-morning pre-caffeinated state, I would recommend using a wide mouth funnel for this step of the process.The assembly process couldn't be simpler, which makes it a great option for backpackers, but I managed to put the handle upside down onto the cap on my first attempt. The grinder actually worked that way, but it's much easier and faster to use with the black knob on top so that it can rest in the hand.  I had enough grinds for my very first cup in about a minute, assembly mistake notwithstanding.I love how quiet the grinder is, and I love the smell of the freshly ground coffee.  I am happy to make this item part of my morning ritual."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Bear with me.  I'm really excited as I'm a newbie to coffee beans so excuse the rambling.  I've been only using this grinder for about a week.  This is my first manual grinder.  Please.  This is my very first grinder.  I've gone from drinking instant Bustelo to Lavazza in a moka pot to now buying organic dark roast from Fairways.  I will be traveling in a few weeks and was simply looking for something easy to pack (and use) as I'm going with steadfast faith to come in contact with a local personal or business roaster.  Grinder arrived quickly as I am a prime member.  I easily assembled the grinder which included finding the correct grind setting and I'm no pro.  I read the preceding company email but I just forged ahead and put enough beans in to grind a single serving (not recommending this - I was excited).  Read comments so knew this wasn't going to be a very quick process.  Didn't even time it.  I was in love with my beans from the first whiff.  Yummmm.  Meh, maybe 1.5 minutes.  I don't know.  I don't spin the crank but churn with love.  Placed ground coffee in moka pot.  I sipped that coffee , nursed the mug and my eyes rolled to the back of my head.  YO! OH THE LIFE THAT IS AHEAD OF ME!! So now I've been using this daily.  I love cranking it.  It builds up my anticipation for coffee.  Like the company email states: Your grinder is now ready for use anywhere in the world!  Yeah!!!!!  And I paid full price for this and have no affiliation to JavaPresse blah blah blah."
"2.0 out of 5 stars","This grinder is fundamentally inconsistent, which is exactly what someone searching for a conical burr grinder does not want. I ended up taking apart my grinder and noticed that some of the parts were just poorly designed, like a square piece fitting into a circle hole. These poor design decisions lead to a semi-floating burr that is off-center, with one side of the conical burr extremely close to the outer burr. This leads to completely weird grind results, with 25% of the beans finely ground, another 25% extremely coarse, and the remaining 50% varying in between.For example, when spinning the handle with no beans loaded, I notice a consistent and repetitive grinding sound as the burrs grind on each other. This should never happen.Ultimately this inconsistency leads to some really bad coffee depending on your brew method. I tried using this grinder for a pour over (chemex) and a French press. Every time I used this grinder the coffee came out over extracted (in the best case) and very bitter but mostly came out terrible.The experience was very frustrating trying to find out why my coffee was terrible but my friend's was great, but within a week I was able to pinpoint it to this grinder.However, I have to say, they have fantastic customer service and they actually sent me a second grinder within a day of contacting them. But, ultimately, the product is flawed and both grinders I have resulted in over-extracted and inconsistent coffee. This grinder is fine if you don't really care about the consistency and just need your beans ground on the go, but just buy your coffee pre-ground before buying this grinder."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","Saw alot of good reviews, so gave this a try. The company asked for a review, so here it is. Have had it for a few weeks now.  I brew for a Chemex and I was impressed with the first grinds, until I had to dismantle it to clean it. There are parts which interconnect and need to align them to get the grinder to work. I had to fiddle with it a few times to get it to grind again. The grinds ended up very fine every time no matter how many clicks, I did for a course grind. Took it apart and redid it a few times, with all the same results. Good for traveling and portability if it works to not give me a espresso grind everytime. I don't think I am allowed to return this after some use of it, I wish I could, $25 landfill. I cannot recommend."
"3.0 out of 5 stars","I'm a novice in this arena... and I was so excited when I hand-ground my first batch!  It felt great!  We were at 5-Stars that week!Now that I am a few months into this.... I'm searching for another Hand Grinder.  Here are some observations regarding the JavaP... agreeing with some 1-Star reviews:Tremendous movement of Inner and Outer Burrs (Major Slop).  Inconsistant Med-Course Grind.Plastic Bushings that will likely fail.  Mine show signs of wear.The Handle will rust if subjected to water.  Mine is starting.It looks identical to a bunch of others out there on Amazon (Why?)It gets 3 stars because:1) It is worth 3/5 of the $24 I paid...... about $152) It looks great next to my other paraphernalia3) It's a great size and feels good in my hand4) It still works (just not accurately)I am saving my pesos for the Precision Bean Hand Grinder, the Handground Model, or maybe the Hiku?.... I'm accepting contributions..... until then, i'm buying my coffee ground.  Good luck in your search!"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","I don't normally leave reviews of products I buy on Amazon, but there's a specific reason why I am writing a review for this product that you'll find out about shortly. In the meantime, here's a brief list of pros vs cons on this product!Pros:-Works great for the Aeropress using a somewhat ''fine'' course setting with the conical burr just about touching the inside burrs-While it does take a full 1-2 minutes to grind an Aeropress scoop worth of beans, it requires very minimal effort-Built-in window is a nice add-on-Relatively easy to clean-Oddly enough, it fits perfectly into the hollow part of the Aeropress plunger for easy transportationCons:-This product is basically the same design as all the other hand grinders available on Amazon, with the same inherent design flaws-As with all hand grinders, the grind you get for your coffee is never 100% consistent-Plastic piece that sits inside the conical burr is very prone to breakage *****SEE BELOW*****Okay, now for the important part! While I cannot speak for the other companies that sell basically the same product, JavaPresse sets themselves apart for their PHENOMENAL customer service! The aforementioned plastic piece inside the conical burr on mine broke after only two months of multiple grinds per day usage. After contacting JavaPresse about my broken burr using their website, I received an email back from them in literally ten to fifteen minutes asking for my address to send me a whole replacement grinder. The person who responded also told me they were going to be releasing an upgraded burr with a nylon insert that would be available within the week.I responded with my address, thanked them for their prompt service and also asked them to alert me when the upgraded burr was available. In response not only did they send me a whole new grinder, but they had just received these upgraded burrs and sent them to me as well!!!! To say I was blown away by the immediate, prompt, and efficient response to my issues with this product is an understatement. Its not often you see or hear of customer service like this anymore!"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Throw that handle away and get out to the toolshed. The Miluakee 8 amp Magnum serves me well in the mornin'. Who wants to quietly grind away at the pile of beans their little hand grinder for half an hour anyways? Turn it up to 11 and really watch the window load with mounds o' grounds. It's kind if like internet were to have suddenly jumped from dial-up to fiber. Is it the intended use? No. But is OSHA going to come issue a notice or something? I'm a man and I do what I please, structural integrity be damned. Its not like the thing cost $100."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","I ordered this item about a month ago and when I received it the top chamber and the bottom chamber that should be separated easily were fused together. This was obviously a defect and I returned it for a full refund. I also sent the company feedback about my experience and I received a prompt response taking responsibility, apologizing, and offering to send me a replacement.I have been using this coffee grinder since then and I'm so pleased that I gave it another shot because it's fantastic and exactly what I was looking for. It easily separates into six parts for cleaning, which I do about once a week, and it's easy to put it back together. It took me only a couple minutes and about a dozen coffee beans to calibrate to the couresness I was looking for for a French press. I made note of how many threads are visible at that calibration so I don't have to recalibrate each time I disassemble it for cleaning.I really wanted to buy this because I was previously using a nutribullet with a milling attachment to grind my coffee beans each morning and it was loud, the couresness was really varied and not ideal for my coffee press, and it was a pain to clean everytime. This coffee grinder takes about ten seconds (yes, I timed it for you) to grind beans for one cup, it's very quiet, and I get uniform size for my coffee press.I would definitely recommend this coffee grinder."
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Unit is smaller than you think it will be, and hold just the right amount of beans for a couple rounds with a french press or aero press.  It does need some elbow grease to grind the beans and it does take longer than the traditional blade or burr grinder - remember,  it's manual, not electric.  So far the grind seems consistent.  Adjusting the grind takes some getting used to as you need to remember click count.  The more clicks, the coarser the grind.  I can't speak to the espresso grind requirement since I don't make it.  I had to go online to learn recommended clicks for the type of grind as that info was not included in the little info flyer included.  It talks about the grind size, using after the desired grind is selected, but does not provide the equivalent number of clicks.  They have a lot of good information online.  Having said that, here are their recommended starting points....  You're welcome.Coarse (13-18 Clicks) - French Press, Cold Brew, Percolator, Coffee CuppingMedium Coarse (10-12 Clicks) - Chemex, Drip Coffee Makers, Vacuum PotsMedium (7-9 Clicks) - Pour Over Brewers (Including Ours), AeropressMedium-Fine (4-6 Clicks) - Moka Pots, Pour Over Brewers, AeropressFine (1-3 Clicks) - Espresso, Turkish"
"1.0 out of 5 stars","Fill with beans, set to medium grind, turn handle 100 times, get about a tablespoon of grind,  To empty the top hopper would require somewhere around 800 rotations.  I value my wrists and elbows too much for this TOTAL lying nonsense.  Apparently every other 'reviewer' is a paid for hack."
"4.0 out of 5 stars","I'm not a coffee connoisseur so was somewhat skeptical that I'd appreciate a burr-ground cuppa joe.  I did try a small electric blade-grinder from a well-known kitchen and bath store and that was an epic fail - big mess, grind was a gajillion different sizes, so ended up grinding the coffee to the consistency of powdered sugar.  I knew I didn't want to spend big $$ on an electric burr grinder -- our kitchen counter is already full.  But, I also wasn't sure I wanted to stand around cranking for a while just to make a cup of coffee.Well, after reading reviews I bought a JavaPresse and I'm sold.  It works as advertised.  It came really well packaged and instructions are pretty self-explanatory.  You do have be really careful when taking apart the burr-section (for cleaning or adjusting) not to lose the spring or washers - so I just did it on my dining room table so anything that rolled or sprung would be easy to find.  I did clean and wash mine first with mild dish soap and had to rinse it *really* well, with the small parts and nooks and crannies.  I used a few beans, as instructions/video suggests, to get the grind consistency right (I use a standard drip coffee maker).  It took a couple of tries to figure out how much beans to add for my single 18oz cup of coffee, but that would be the case with pre-ground coffee too.What I like: the coffee flavor really pops with grinding immediately before brewing (as I said, I was skeptical).  The device is really easy to use, especially if you hold the canister with one hand and kind of rotate the opposite direction of the cranking with the other hand. I only make one cup at a time, so it is convenient for me and takes about a minute of grinding - kind of meditative (nah, not really).  Easy to clean.  Compact.  I bought a second one that I keep at the office.  Price is right.What some may not like:  I really does seem to be perfect for a single (large) cup of coffee, or two small cups of coffee.  It would not be ideal if one is making coffee for a few people or a group."
"3.0 out of 5 stars","We used to have a grain grinder that was stones rather than blades and loved it.  We know it takes a bit more time and manual labor, but we are a bit surprised at how long it takes to grind coffee. After about 3 minutes the first time, my husband went to the garage and came back with his drill. He proceeded to take off the handle, and attach drill and it still took 2 more minutes to grind the coffee up.  He has done this for a week now, and although we knew it only held enough coffee for about 5 cups, this is way too little coffee for how long it takes to get it ground and ready.  My 22 year old son was making coffee and said by the time he was ready to drink, it felt like 20 minutes.  That is just a long time to make coffee.."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","I was really excited for this grinder at first. Got the grinder and tried it out for the first time to see that on a medium setting it was producing both fine and extra coarse grounds. I took a look at the burr to see that the center burr was not centered and was closer to the outer burr on one side and far from it on the other making an uneven grind. I reported the problem and Amazon overnighted another grinder so 5 star customer service, but the problem was even more pronounced on the second grinder with one side of the center burr constantly touching the wall of the outer burr on a medium to coarse setting. Not a good grinder at all"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","This is a nice grinder.  My previous one had a big glass jar to collect the grinds, which made it harder to grip.  This one is much easier to grip, but it still holds enough to grind a double shot of espresso (maybe 2).  At first, it seemed kind of weird that the handle doesn't screw onto the top, but it works better than the last one I had.  With that one I always had to tighten the screw half-way through the grind.  This one just works.The only negative I've had so far is that they give you a website to go to for videos on how to set up and care for your grinder, but then the website wants your e-mail address before it will show the videos.  Of course, like everything else, the videos are on Youtube.  Problem solved.  Setup was pretty intuitive anyway so it didn't take long to get brewing."
"4.0 out of 5 stars","I've never grinded my own beans before and I'm glad I did my research and chose a manual grinder over an electric blade grinder. It's very satisfying being able to crunch the beans up yourself. Sort of therapeutic. The reason I took 1 star off though is because my first grinder had a slightly off-center burr so I was getting an uneven grind and the smallest grain size I could get was medium with some larger flakes. The burr would also gradually open as I grinded beans, starting out as medium and ending as big flakes if I didn't stop halfway through and readjust it. I emailed the company and they promptly sent me out a new one. Kudos for that! The new one didn't appear to have the same defect. However after grinding just two full canisters, the burr in the replacement grinder has also become off-center. If I push hard enough I can recenter it, but it'll just go back out of alignment halfway through the grinding process. But it isn't nearly as bad as the first one, so it's not that big of a deal. If you're looking for perfect consistency, spend more on a grinder, but if you're like me, brand new to the world of grinding coffee beans, then you know it's really not that big of a deal for $20. The company is really nice and generous so I still feel like my money was pretty well spent."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","UPDATE 11/20/2017After writing my initial review the Javapresse company reached out to me and sent me a brand new grinder free of charge. I have to say the original one I received must have been defective because the one that they sent over works great! I can pull an amazing shot out of it using my Gaggia espresso machine and it tastes great. I also purchased a grinder from another company here on amazon that looked the same as the JavaPresse however it seems to me that the JavaPresse actually grinds the beans faster at the same consistency. All in all I am very happy they reached out to me and now I can happily change my rating to a 5 star.!______________________________Incredibly disappointed with this product. When I received it the packaging looked great and I was really excited to start using it, seemed simple and easy enough to use. After putting in my coffee bean I noticed immediately something was wrong as the burr grinder would not spin. I removed the beans and tested it, and the burr grinder began to spin. So I added the beans back again and to no avail the grinder did not spin. I did this a couple of more times and then I simply added 1 coffee bean, that stopped the grinder from spinning as well.I then though well maybe it was assembled wrong, after inspecting the device further I noticed that the burr inside the grinder was not sturdy at all and moved all over the place, I am not sure how a grinder that has the burr moving so much could ever produce a consistent grind. However I can't confirm this as I was not able to even grind 1 bean. Now ill have to order from a different company and won't be able to enjoy my espresso for another 3 days, and for a coffee lover like myself this makes me furious, hence the one star review."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","I don't mind taking my time to grind the coffee, however this grinder produced very inconsistent results - the bottom of the grounds have the large chunks, and the finely ground coffee sits at the top. See picture for the “fine” grind setting. Thought I would be getting a better product given the great reviews..."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","My unit arrived with a conical burr that wouldn't align with the outer clyindrical burr. This causes my coffee grinds to be far from uniform in size, which means this grinder (from the factory) is about as useful as a bladed herb grinder. The plastic bits give me reason to be concerned about the lifespan of this grinder, and out of the box it fails to perform as designed or described. I would not recommend this product to anyone who is passionate about their morning coffee routine.I've been able to modify the grinder to work in a decent fashion, but only time and repetition will tell if my mod has worked. If not, refund here I come.12/4/18 Edit: modification didnt hold, grinder is producing extremely uneven coffee particles. Don't buy this grinder."
"2.0 out of 5 stars"," I bought this grinder to use occasionally for a course grind in a French press or for cold brewing when I buy whole beans. I liked the idea of a manual grinder, so I wouldn't have to worry about any electrical components failing, shorting out, etc. The reviews for this were great, and videos site on the Javapresse website made it seem easy enough to grind.However, this required a LOT more elbow grease than I'd imagined. I tried with some Colombian beans which I filled almost to the top. As you can see from my video, it takes quite a bit of grip and force to get it cranking - someone with weak hands or arthritis definitely wouldn't be able to use this. You can also see that the sleek stainless steel design caused it to just spin right through my hand while trying to grind; it was very hard to get a good grip on it. I tried wrapping it in rubber bands, using a kitchen potholder to add extra grip, and holding it against my chest instead of on the countertop, but it kept on spinning and slipping through my hand. It also kept getting stuck - I'd have to back off a bit and then try again to keep it moving. Besides trying to add more grip, I also tried adding fewer beans (filling halfway instead of to the top), as well as disassembling and reassembling it to make sure the components were lined up correctly, but it still took just as much effort. My hands hurt!Unless I somehow got a defective model, I can't imagine using this on a daily basis since it took so much effort to grind a quarter cup of coffee, and was almost impossible to keep a good grip on it while grinding because of its smooth design. The only thing I liked about it was its compact design, which could have stayed on the counter without taking up too much space. Sadly, I'll be returning it and will probably replace with an electric blade grinder after all."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Since my first order was about a year ago, my family and I have been using our JavaPresse without any issues.  It is very sturdy and reliable.  Wanting to find a device that can ''crack'' larges amounts of Pepper corns and other spices for cooking, my son asked, why do you try our JavaPresse?  At first I was reluctant to try it because I didn't want to mix my coffee flavor with pepper and the other spices but I decided to give it a try after cleaning it.  I was amazed that I actually found a pepper grinder/cracker that actually cracked the pepper about as perfect as I wanted, and I needed about 2 cups of fresh cracked pepper.  My JavaPresse did it within just a few minutes.So long story short, I ended up purchasing my second JavaPresse coffee grinder / spice cracker that I have been looking for so I don't have Just a very sturdy product and the customer service and information is great.  Outstanding product for both coffee beans and your spices."
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Overall, a pretty decent manual coffee grinder. There are a few quality-of-life issues that can be annoying; hopefully they will be addressed in a later generation of this product.Pros:1) Can grind anything from fine to coarse for a variety of uses2) Perfect size for 1-2 people3) Doesn't take very long to grind a cup worth on the coarse side of the spectrum (a little more work on the fine side)4) Fresh coffee every morning!5) Stainless steel is pretty nice6) Reasonably pricedCons/Areas for Improvement:1) The top slides into the base on the bottom (metal against metal) with no way to hold the two parts together. If you hold by the bottom while grinding, the top will spin and it won't actually grind. If you hold from the top, the bottom comes off spilling coffee grounds everywhere. It is awkward to hold the two pieces together.2) Sometimes it's just really hard to grind, and I have no idea why. I've cleaned it thoroughly, and I'm relatively young and strong, so it's not like I lack the strength to grind the beans. It's just hard to get a good grip on the slippery metal, and I end up squeezing so hard my hand hurts (to keep the base from spinning in my hand). A handle would be nice. I've been wrapping that rubber drawer liner around the device to get a better grip.3) Kind of difficult to clean4) I often switch between coarse for my cold brew (in a French press) and medium-fine for drip, and it can be challenging to find the right grind level each time. The instructions say to grind ~10 beans at a time to see how you should vary the grind level; that is fine if you set it and forget it. If you change often, it just gets annoying, and is a waste of good beans5) If you have larger hands, the crank while often rub against your knuckles. You may need to awkwardly crank by your finger tipsDespite the many areas for improvement, I don't regret this purchase; however, I will be looking to replace it when I come across the right product."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","First thing out of the box, I loosen the burr to test turn it and the burr is offset, narrow on one end wide on the other. I take it off to inspect it for any debris that could cause it, and the ceramic burr itself is pitted and deformed. The plastic insert holding the burr to the central rod is loose, letting the burr wobble and not get a consistent grind.When I set it to a ''fine'' size, the burr will press against the outer wall, making it hard to turn.All in all garbage quality product. Don't waste your time ordering this to just have to return it."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","This grinder lasted less than 6 months of daily use.  I was hoping that it would be a good purchase since I don't want a grinder that requires electricity.  Apparently the search is still on.  This grinder has cheap plastic parts inside that snapped in half.  I do not recommend for anyone looking for a good grinder...."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Build Quality: 5/5The exterior components are crafted of heavy weight stainless steel from the bottom up to the hand crank. Each component feels sturdy and long lasting. The grinder breaks down into three pieces: bottom reservoir (part where grinds fall), upper reservoir (part where you place beans), cap (seals off upper reservoir), and the hand crank.Grind Quality: 5/5Since this grinder utilizes burr technology, the beans will not be heated during the grinding process like they would from a traditional bladed grinder. Additionally, the particle size is uniform as the grinds only fall to the bottom reservoir once they are small enough to fall through the grinding mechanism, ensuring a uniform size on every ground. This is important when brewing to ensure each grind is subjected to the same amount of heat and water during the brew. Inside the grinding mechanism, there is a portion where you turn it clockwise or counterclockwise to adjust the ground size. There are no markings to know what size is being produced so experimenting will be necessary. I'd recommend starting large and then going small - that way you can recycle the larger grounds and continue the process until you've reached an ideal size.Overall: 4.5/5The reservoir size is quite small, so if you're using this for cold brew where a large quantity of grounds are necessary, you may need to repeat the process several times. It holds about 5 rounded tablespoons of coffee beans (about 1/3 cup). Grind time takes about 1-2 minutes to complete if completely full.Overall, this grinder has held up so far, produces consistent grounds, and I'm sure will last for many more cups to come."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","I initially purchased this grinder to make pour-over coffee.  It seemed to work okay, but the grind never felt very even.  When I opened it up to look inside, I saw that conical burr piece was not centered with the exterior grinding component (I don't know the proper terms for these pieces).  Unfortunately, after getting an espresso machine, the uneven grind and the inability to grind fine enough forced me to use a blade grinder after manually grinding the beans. I have been unable to make a quality espresso using this grinder even at the finest setting, before or after disassembling and cleaning the inside.  I will NOT be buying this again and will be looking into a different manual coffee grinder that produces an even grind (which is the point of a burr grinder)."
"3.0 out of 5 stars","So after much research I finally decided to go with this manual grinder over many other electric burr grinders. Mainly because I'm just using it for a Chemex 3 cup and me looking to on average brew 2-3 cups a coffee at a time. The support for this product from the OE was outstanding before I even opened the box.I have used it twice now, it is a high quality product however the ability to dial the coarseness in is difficult at best. There is only one little non-marked or indicated wheel at the bottom with the hopper removed. One direction for coarse one for fine but no way of telling without actually grinding what level it is to either. I find this quite frustrating when trying to dial in the exact right coarseness for pour over coffee.  I need to seek some support from the manufacturer to see if there is something I'm missing but nothing that is outlined in the instructions. I've even started looking again at low end price point electrics to avoid this hassle. Not a bad review overall as once again the support and build quality of this item is great and it does grind very consistently far surpassing my old blade only electric grinder."
"4.0 out of 5 stars","The JavaPresse Manual Coffee Grinder is exactly as described. A well-made, well-designed hand crank Coffee grinder.Who should buy it? Anyone who needs to make good coffee without electricity. Anyone who makes coffee when the rest of the house is sleeping. It's very quiet. Someone who wants excellent home brew coffee but who's budget won't cover an electric burr grinder.If I like it so much why 4 stars instead of 5? It's slow. It takes longer to fine grind for 1 cup of coffee than it takes to heat the water. Grinding enough for a 12 cup coffee maker is a chore.Features I like:Ceramic cone grinding surface makes very uniform sized coffee grounds, which makes very good coffee. Metal parts are precision stainless steel. It is the first grinder I have owned that will grind fine enough to make Turkish coffee. Easy to use and easy to adjust from course to fine grind. Removing the adjustment screw opens the insides for cleaning. It is very quiet. Looks and feels like it will last a long time. It is large enough to make enough grounds for a very stong 12 cups.Limitations: Other than how long it takes to grind, the only limitation I see is that if you also grind spices you are going to need a separate grinder. The main working surfaces are easy to get to and clean but there are some crevasses around the grinding cone that you can't get the coffee powder all out of.Bottom line, I will keep and use this grinder but I am going to spring for an electric burr grinder for everyday use."
"2.0 out of 5 stars","I used this grinder for approx. 5 weeks (14-20g, twice daily) before the plastic right above the burrs was getting ripped. Javapresse customer service was excellent, sending me another grinder AND a refund, however, due to damage, and other design flaws, I can't recommend this grinder. 1 star for grinder, 1 star added for excellent customer service.Pros- Excellent customer service- Cheap- LightCons- inconsistent grind - feels like you're crushing beans rather than slicing them, giving you a wide range of grind sizes, especially if you're trying to grind coarser, say for a french press. This made for very inconsistent brewing. Only an Aeropress recipe with a fine grind size worked okay.- very slow to grind (takes 3-5 minutes for a fine setting)- the handle isn't very comfortable (not a big deal, but for such a long grind time, it would be nice)- basket is too loose (slips as you grind - it never fell completely, but I always had to make sure my hand was covering both parts to ensure that it wouldn't)- not durable (see photo)- grinds get stuck in basket - weird design with a little lip at the bottom, so fine grounds will get stuck, forcing you to smack it a bunch to loosen them up. (see photo)- after disassembling and reassembling to clean, my grind settings weren't the same. Requires re-figuring to dial in the recipe.Replaced it with a Comandante C40, which isn't fair to compare as that's in a completely different class, but all these problems listed above are gone. You do get what you pay for.Speculative note: If I were to travel and wanted to take an Aeropress and this grinder, I would be okay, although a smaller one like the Porlex mini would probably be a better choice. If you want something of a little higher quality yet, but still small and portable, I'd consider the Aergrind knock."
"2.0 out of 5 stars","Imagine bicycling everywhere in first gear. Little resistance but you don't get anywhere fast.Was told that a manual coffee grinder gave you a small workout each morning. No issues with that. However the long, perhaps 6'', lever arm just too long to grind out two cups of coffee's worth of ground coffee. Would probably be writing a positive review if the grinder had a 2'' arm.Don't believe any instructions came with the grinder. Rather I had to go online to find out how to adjust the grind's coarseness.Didn't find any written instructions online for the grinder rather only found a video. Prefer written instructions as written instructions use less bandwidth and are easier to jump around in.No clear indication of when the grind adjustment is going to ''slip'' off the end so the burrs can be cleaned.As a substitute for an electric grinder, this grinder is not an option. However if there is a reason that you need freshly ground coffee, either off grid or traveling, this is a viable option but just not worth it if you can use an electric grinder.I did receive the nice ''we care'' purchase follow up email from Javepresse. However I never received a response from them after sending them a less than neutral review of the grinder.Would like to return it to Amazon but unfortunately have already thrown away the box."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Recommended item. Works great. Will grind as fine as you need and fine enough for lever espresso machine.  It is comfortable to use as you can grind vertical and horizontal. It works and does a great job and you can't beat the price. And the receptacle that holds the coffee after it is ground fits into the portafilter so you can tap the coffee right into it. How smart! I like it and I have nothing negative to say about the machine. Keep in mind that it ain't an electric machine so you will grind 14 grams of coffee in about 10 minutes or less.I do have something negative to say about the instructions which are a waste of time and so is the website video showing the dude that likes to listen to himself going on on on and wasting time. What needs to be shown clearly is: in what direction do the washers go when putting the machine back together after cleanning. Up or down? Can't be seen clearly in the video or in the instructions that come with the unit. A waste of time trying to figure it out. There is a top washer that needs to be put back correctly either up or down and a bottom washer that also needs to be put back in the correct direction. The information provided is a waste of time. Also, some type of warning needs to be given so that no grinding is attempted in the zero position because seems to me-I don't know-that the burrs can be worn down or damaged. If it doesn't matter, hey, more to power you but I heard crunching in the zero position. It's a great machine but Javapresse should have paid little more money an have gotten better qualified people to provide the instructions and the video on the machine. It ain't rocket science to crank the handle but clear instructions  would be helpful. But other than that, I personally like and recommend this unit."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","First, the good parts: it grinds coffee, and lets you select grind sizes from somewhat coarse to really coarse. It's definitely more consistent than a typical electric blade grinder.The bad: the plastic piece between the adjustment knob and the grinding burr 'slips' on its shaft. This means that you have to very carefully wiggle the handle to get the grinder to continue grinding, or just 'push past' and break the grinder. After about a week, I was stuck on the adjustment i was on, and today... while grinding, it screwed itself completely tight (to the finest grind) and jammed.Also, the outer metal is pretty reactive with kitchen surfaces. I still have marks on my counter where the grinder slipped and left metal behind.Total. Garbage."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","I bought this coffee grinder to replace a plastic Bialetti one that only lasted a year. I was looking for something sturdier than that one, and picked this one for its metal body and good reviews.Unfortunately, this is mostly useless. - The grinds are too coarse at all settings, and not of uniform size. I can't make espresso from this. - It grinds so slowly, takes forever to get enough. - It's tiny. - The bottom container isn't secured to the top and feels flimsy. It spins in my hand when I grind, and I'm worried I'm gonna spill all my hard work.It's looks good however, and is very quiet. Probably because it grinds so poorly.I'm gonna get another plastic one, even though I know it won't last. At least it's good until it breaks. This one, I might use for white pepper. Probably not though, I'll likely just chuck it out. I won't return it, because I don't want anyone else to have to get stuck with this useless trash."
"4.0 out of 5 stars","This hand held burr grinder is very easy to use. If you pick it up, its light and easy to carry, however, it will take a while to grind your coffee.  I love to make pour over coffee since I found out what it was, and I love the consistency of the grind with this little machine.  However, just know that it is a hand held burr grinder, and as such there is no gearing to quickly dispatch your grounds.  This is a slow methodical process of grinding coffee.  If you are going to take this hiking, camping, fishing, hunting, or simply want to go to the beach to make a fantastic cup of joe, this is the right tool for the job, but it will take more than a couple of minutes to grind all the coffee you need for one cup.I do suggest this for coffee aficionados and connoisseurs, this machine is fantastic, the burr grinder is ceramic, not metallic or plastic and as such creates a perfect grind.  Its also very quiet and on cold dark mornings when you are trying to make a cup of coffee before  anyone wakes up, this works perfectly.  Just don't expect to read anything, or participate in much more than conversation.If I were to ask for one thing to be changed, it would be a gear system installed to increase the speed of the burr grinder just 2 times. This machine is very manual, and having a simple 1:2 gear would make this go by so much faster."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","The only real positives to take away form this product seem to be that it's made of fairly strong materials and has a relatively consistent grind size. However, using the actual grinder is more than frustrating. To start, the grinder only holds about enough beans for about one cup of coffee, so prepared to empty and fill numerous times if you plan on grinding more than that. There is no retention feature for the bottom half receptacle, nor is there one for the lever arm you use to grind. As a result, the grinder will fall apart during use if not held in the proper manner. While the grinder has ''settings'' for grind size, they aren't based on anything. Setting the size involves bottoming out the burrs and then backing off from there. There is still no marker for what size you are currently at, if you forgot how many steps you counted or haven't reset the device before using.  Setting the size also feels like you may break the thing, given how difficult it is to set.Avoid this product if possible."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","I wanted to write a two-part review covering both the product as well as the company's customer service.  I'll start with the grinder.  This JavaPresse burr grinder is a nice, sleek little grinder that looks good enough to leave on your counter instead of hiding in the back of a cupboard.  Depending on how strong you like your coffee, you can fill this to the brim with beans and it is just about right for two cups.  That being said, a larger version might be nice in order to grind more coffee with each fill.  So far it seems to produce a pretty consistent grinder unless the burr gets pushed to one side a bit.  I think this is due to some of the internal parts being plastic and having a little give in them.  I haven't noticed it being a huge issue, but it can move around a bit so that one side produces finer grounds while the other produces larger grounds.  I think it's more prevalent when you are trying for a coarse grind.As far as the customer service, JavaPresse is up there with the best of them.  I had an issue with my initial delivery, and since they had proactively sent an email with some tips on the grinder, I reached out about the issue I was having.  Jacque was very friendly and prompt in addressing my issue and getting it resolved.  Definitely recommend giving this company a chance to serve your coffee needs!"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","I replaced a $40 Cuisinart burr grinder that was a mess, it ground grounds, just left a ton of dust & uneven grinds to deal with.  It was barely adequate but cheapish for my one-cup-a-day habit.  Since I didn't want to spend over $100 on a decent electric, I started to look over this one & it does not disappoint!  It grinds PERFECT pour over - so uniform!  No more dust & no more static!  I absolutely love everything about this except I'm 50 & I have arthritis so it is a bit of a struggle to get my sore hands to work through the 3 minutes of hand grinding early in the morning.  But, this is not the fault of the grinder for sure!  It is still worth the efforts & the wait for the quality of brew!  My only complaint is that there is no way to keep the setting so if you change to a different type of brew, you will have to play with it a bit to find the right spot & then be willing to loose it the next time you change.  Right now I have a perfect pour over set but eventually I will want to make french press or espresso & I will have to take the time to adjust it & grind some beans until I find the perfect spot.  It isn't rocket science to adjust it, I just miss my old machine where I put a sticker on the settings I preferred...this one, due to it's size & design, won't allow for such luxuries.  This grinder is just pure function & it does that well!!  & it looks super cute & doesn't take up any space on my counter AND it didn't break the bank!!!Update: I've been using this daily since August.  Earlier this week the grind got way off, grinding way too big for even french press.  So, I kept adjusting it & it would unscrew & grind big again about halfway through.  I finally decided to watch the video of how to clean & did so & discovered the little washer at the top of the shaft was broken.  I contacted Javapresse & they got back to me within 2 days & said they would send out replacement washers & a spring.  So, for now, I will keep this as a 5 star rating, I love love love this grinder!!"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","I've not found a better one out there.  But - like anything - it does have parts that wear.  I've had this one for close to a year now, and have used it every day.  About a month ago, a coffee bean part got wedged, but I was still able to turn it.  I actually didn't know there was a bean stuck in there - but I did notice the ceramic cylinder had gotten just a tiny bit cockeyed.  After being taken apart COMPLETELY, it was found that the pressure from the bean had loosened the black liner from the stainless steel.  Because of this, when the crank was turned - the beans spun around with it.  So ... we took it apart again, and applied a food grade silicon sealant to reattach it to the stainless.  Used it again this morning - and it's as good as new.  I really do like this grinder, so we'll do what we can to keep it going strong."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","I make incense, and I bought this to grind the things that take too much time and effort to grind with a mortar and pestle.  IT'S AMAZING. Turns easily, adjusts easily, cleans easily, and gives me a really consistent grind all the way down to the finest powder. We don't use bladed electric grinders because they heat the ingredients enough that they release too much of their fragrance constituents. This kind of assisted hand grinding produces the best result for things that depend on keeping all their lovely aromas intact.  I imagine this is just as important in a cup of coffee as it is in a jar of incense.  I'm buying a second one for coffee.  Should be a real flavor revelation!"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","The material quality is just fine but there are three  things I am not happy about: 1- the clear plastic that will definitely not as clean and transparent when aged; 2- the connection between the upper and lower part are getting a bit lose only after 1 month of use; 3- the grinder gears ( ceramic may be )  are not that well designed, they do not force (that much)  the beans to go down as it turns. This latter results in long grinding process and shaking to get the beans in place. This tend to happen more in a place where humidity is high and coffee beans are not freshly roasted.Compared to other brand that I used for over 4 years ( go find out which one is the second best rated here on amazon) this is not an improvement , but it looks like they are good at marketing this design and the brand so I thought I would give it a try. I returned the unit and bought my preferred one. By the way, my old grinder has nothing wrong, I simply don't have it with me now and I need another grinder. I suggest you look around and try different designs; one star reviews could be an indicator of problems but most of the time there would be 5% of negative experiences ( just like mine now) ."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Spoiler alert- got a dud the first time around, replacement is a great grinder, awesome customer service experienceI am a relative newcomer to being a regular coffee drinker ... used to not drink much coffee, then I had a kid who doesn't sleep well :) I got an aero press for Christmas, then settled on the javapresse grinder to be able to grind whole beans (my husband does not drink coffee so the coffee is just for me, so we don't need a large quantity ground at one time.)I received my grinder quickly, and immediately tried it out. I could not seem to get a fine grind, always seemed coarse. I thought it was just my inexperience, so I kept experimenting over the next couple weeks with the adjustment knob but kept getting similar results, went to the javapresse website and watched all the videos. Then, the black knob on the handle fell off! So, I emailed customer service. They were super responsive (emailed back within a few hours) and immediately said they would send out a full replacement right away. I received the replacement the very next day. Did a test grind and got much better results. Now that I have something to compare, on the original grinder I received, the adjustment knob wasn't ''clicking'' and could never seem to get beyond a coarse grind. I can't comment on the durability etc of the grinder since I haven't had it long, will come back and update if I run into any problems.So, if your grinder doesn't seem to be working like it should, contact customer service!"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","This worked really well for about a year.I used it in average once a day.The last time I used it I heard the sounds of ceramic grinding against ceramic and discovered the plastic that keeps the shaft centered broken into brittle pieces.Strange that an almost all metal construction would use cheap plastic where the most stress is.I don't recommend."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","A few days in and so far so great!I use a mocha pot (actually a Kamira) , and sometimes use a coffee press.  The adjustments on this are superb.  This Kamira prefers a grind between espresso and coffee press, which is harder to find in the story.  Therefore I'm excited to be able to make it myself!One benefit of this grinder is it can do Turkish grind and I'm excited to try that out.Note that It does take a while to grind the coffee, so if you're not interested in a workout this may not be for you.  It takes me one to two minutes to grind a tablespoon of coffee beans.  Since I'm using a small coffee maker that's okay.  For a good old fashion drip coffee machine I don't think this is the right grinder for you unless you want to be grinding beans for a while.."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","I use this with a v60 at the cabin, camp ground, airbnb, and hotel when we don't want to bring along our larger grinder. I even use when we're at home occasionally. It's very compact without sacrificing a decent grind. My only complaint is that the grind adjustment would be difficult to dial in if you need to change it often. It's not a big deal if you're using the same brewing method most of the time. I give it a few clicks in either direction depending on the roast, but if you don't use it for a while it's hard to remember where your baseline is at."
"4.0 out of 5 stars","This is not a $200-$400 coffee grinder. It's not reasonable to expect a perfectly uniform grind from a grinder under $30. It's still much better than a blade grinder as it doesn't turn a quarter of your coffee beans into dust.This unit feels sturdy and grinds quietly. My old blade grinder was louder than a commercial vacuum cleaner. The trick to getting a decent grind out of this device is to run your grounds through TWICE. I thought I wasn't setting it fine enough at first as there were large chunks of bean in my grounds after one pass. After two passes, you get a pretty consistent grind.It doesn't take very long to grind enough beans (just under four tablespoons) for my small french press. Maybe a little bit longer than it takes my electric kettle to heat up the water, which happens rather quickly. I haven't timed it but it's not a bothersome amount of time.If you're looking to grind coffee for large batches, say for drip coffee, you'll have to do several batches to get enough grounds. You're probably still going to want an electric burr grinder for that. Unless you just need the workout."
"2.0 out of 5 stars","I bought this product looking for a gateway into home brewed coffee at an affordable price, willing to trade a few minutes each morning for affordability to do so. Unfortunately my experience so far has been frustrating and the coffee I've brewed disappointing.The instructions are unclear and unhelpful. I've spent a few hours over the past week alone trying to figure out how to configure the grind quality between rereading the instructions multiple times, rewatching the video they link you, and just testing it out by hand, and I still cannot figure out how to properly do this. You're told you do this by  ''turning it all the way to the right and hearing x amount of clicks'', but after turning knobs for too long in either direction, I'm not given any obvious cues to tell me how to adjust it properly. First I grinded them too coarsely, then I somehow was able to adjust it to its finest setting and I can't get out out of it. Being able to adjust this should be obvious!This is on top of the time commitment actually grinding the coffee, which as users have pointed out can take at least 2 minutes but for me has taken closer to 5. It doesn't seem like much, but 2-5 minutes of actively grinding beans is deceptively long and it adds up. Imagine you're planking 2-5 minutes and that's how pleasant the experience is.It pains me to leave this review because this is a small business that seems to genuinely care about its product and customers. I really wanted to start enjoying the home brewing experience, but unfortunately I can't recommend this product to anyone given the frustrating experience I've had with it."
"4.0 out of 5 stars","I can not say anything special about quality. It's not stellar. It's just fine. As for durability - only after using it for a long time I can either recommend or not. But I was totally disappointed overall by the idea of using a manual grinder. When I  make cappuccino I used to go with double-shots. With an electric grinder, it took about 3-4 min to have a cup ready. Multiply by a number of people. The manual grinder adds about 4-5 min per serving. It's funny but it takes me less time to pump up an inflatable paddle board! I get it - sometimes it may work as a meditation. But the most of the times it's less than convenient."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","This little grinder is great for grinding coffee extra fine for Turkish coffee. The only downside is that it is slow work - it takes me close to 10 minutes to grind a few tablespoons of beans for myself. However, I understand that's par for the course with hand grinders, so I don't think that's a flaw on the part of this product specifically. I find things go a bit faster if I first grind the beans in a regular Krups grinder, then run them through this to get them extra fine, though it still takes a few minutes. Recommended for personal use by those who enjoy Turkish coffee but don't want to shell out the money for an expensive fancy grinder, if you don't mind using a little elbow grease. Not a practical option for grinding large quantities of beans for multiple people or servings, though - it would simply take too much time and effort."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","I had very high expectations for this product due to the price and reviews. The fit of the pieces is excessively tight. I have to strain myself to get this thing apart and back together. Started turning the handle clockwise as recommended and the screw holding the crank on just fell out. It's not even reverse threaded, so the crank just falls apart with normal use. Returning this."
"4.0 out of 5 stars","I posted a two start review a while ago and the company reached out to me and sent me a replacement grinder for free.  They were very nice and the grinder was shipped to me very quickly, however I was out of whole bean coffee so I've only just now gotten around to trying it out.The new grinder was much smoother and I was able to feel when to stop since the resistance decreases significantly.  It was much smoother an easier than with the original grinder I got and I was able to grind 25 grams of coffee (my usual amount for my 16oz pour over) in about 90 seconds.  I'm updating my review to four starts for the excellent service and the fact that the grinder does work pretty darn well.  Thanks to the JavaPresse folks and their excellent support!Old Review:Good for the Aeropress and nothing elseIf you want a coffee grinder that's small and portable to use with an Aeropress somewhere where you can't make too much noise, this will work great for you.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really work for anything else.  Even on the coarsest setting the grounds I get from this are too fine for my pour over and I can't even imagine how tedious it would be to use this for finer grinds like espresso."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Don't usually do reviews and I'm the usual 5 out of 10 reviewer :) I did post this on my Facebook page after 3 days of use:''Well my Mr. Coffee coffee grinder that I have had for 20+ years finally gave it up. So I started to look around for a replacement. A lot of options out there now (not that many 20 years ago). I won't say I'm a ''coffee snob'' but to some, maybe I am. I always grind my own and use my espresso maker for a 4 shot cup. I use Espresso, Italian, French roasts, and change pace with Guatemalan and Sumatra.I saw this one after reading a lot more in-depth articles on grinders. The best you can really get are the conical ceramic burr grinders, not the old blades I have been using. The burr process actually grinds the coffee beans in a consistent size and not heat up the beans like metal blades.So, I thought what the heck, and this one looked like fun and possibly the even size will be easier on my machine.WOW! First cup, I was amazed! Not sure it was just some sort of anticipation or not, so had a second cup, then switched to Sumatra for another cup! Yep, results were all the same. The even size and gentle grinding actually produced more body and flavor and took the bite/edge right off of the espresso roast. Karen (coffee hater) wasn't sure to believe me, but I make an Americano for my grandson Saturday mornings, he even claimed the coffee was a lot smoother!If you start looking for a new grinder, I strongly suggest and know you won't be disappointed using the Ceramic Conical Grinders. Worth the extra bucks!''"
"1.0 out of 5 stars","I wanted to like this hand coffee grinder.  But, the quality is lacking.  I ordered August 26, received August 28.  Tonight (September 28) the item stopped working.  The ceramic burr became stuck and no longer grinds.  I realize the price is low, but 1 month is unacceptable.  I'll be contacting the manufacturer, and depending on the response I may update this review to reflect the customer service experience."
"4.0 out of 5 stars","What I like about the JavaPresse, it looks sleek, simplistic and isn't intimidating to use.  It grinded well, and made great coffee.  Clean up was a relative breeze.  I can see using this on a daily basis... with a few caveats....1) the compartment on the bottom (which catches the ground coffee) needs to be either tighter or lockable via a twist.  The first day I used it, I gripped onto the main body of the grinder and started my process and halfway through the bottom fell out.... all my hard work grinding thus far was on the floor... what a mess...2) the necessity to hold the bottom compartment makes it difficult to hold the main body firmly while grinding.  This was especially true for finer grinds (I was using it for my Aeropress) and noticed that if I didn't hold the body firmly it would just start spinning, but trying to hold both compartments (body and bottom grind compartment) was a strain on my hand and arm.  If there was a silicone grip on the body, it would make it  much easier (that or textured metal) because the shiny smooth steel makes it hard to prevent it from spinning alongside the grinder arm.Other than that, I have been enjoying this fun little grinder and making consistent grinds for my daily coffee.Recommended!"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","[updated 2/10/19] I tested this on some whole roasted beans from Peet's. It was almost an enjoyable experience for me, just standing in the kitchen rotating the crank. Granted I wasn't in a rush, but I could turn out enough grounds for a 13oz French Press fairly quickly. It's a manual grinder, don't expect quick grounds.- - - - - -I'm going to fully review after I've tried the grinder in conjunction with their free month of coffee offer. But......after unboxing, I realized they haven't really addressed how to protect it on the go, given that it's main convenience is its portability (in my opinion). Am I just supposed to throw this in a backpack or briefcase as two pieces? I personally won't lose the handle, but I'm sure others will if they're packed separately. Furthermore, the beautiful stainless steel will become nicked and scratched over time if left to GRIND around with keys, pens, loose change, etc. I almost expected it to come in a drawstring bag...If JavaPresse ends up reading this, you should  design and distribute a cylindrical drawstring bag with an externally-attached sleeve for the handle. Imagine how suave this product would look coming out of a microfiber black bag - from a modern apartment to camping in the wilderness!If anyone has the skill to make one for me, I'll take it as a donation for the idea - ha!"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","I echo the comments of a previous reviewer who noted that grinding proceeds slowly. It takes forever to grind enough beans for 1-1/2 cups of coffee, which is just not something I'm willing to do five or more days per week. I'm not opposed to a little elbow grease, but if it's any indication, my Apple Watch always thinks I've started an Elliptical workout because the grinding goes on for several minutes. On a related note, 1-1\2 cups is about all it can handle at one time (grinding for a French Press).I feel like the unit would be improved it were just a little bit larger. It couldn't be too much larger because one still needs to be able to hold it in one's hand. But if the capacity were a little bit higher and (critically) the mill itself were slightly larger, I would think it could grind more coffee faster. The aforementioned 1-1/2 cups just happens to be enough to fill my thermos, so I'm fortunate that it meets my minimum daily need. However, ideally I would get at least two cups of coffee out of this thing so I don't have to grind beans repeatedly when I have company.I have also noticed that the grind setting (once you find it through trial & error) doesn't remain constant. I was grinding away the other morning and it seemed as though it was taking even longer than normal. When I finally finished, the grind was suddenly much finer than it should have been. It wasn't immediately apparent, but thinking back over the days leading up to this particular morning, I believe it was slowly grinding beans finer and finer. Perhaps the clockwise motion of the mill gradually tightened the wheel. If so, I shutter to think how tedious it must be to use this mill to grind beans fine enough for espresso.Overall it's decently made and for an infrequent user or for people who camp, it's probably worth having. I just don't think it's suitable for every day use by avid coffee drinkers."
"4.0 out of 5 stars","It's a manual grinder with ceramic burrs.  There are many on the market and most will do a great job of producing consistent ground coffee.  Once you have the grind size dialed in, you won't likely have to touch the adjustment unless you change the type of coffee you're using.If you're grinding for espresso... you'll be getting a workout.  As others have noted, espresso grinds for two will likely take 6-7 minutes of elbow grease!  Grinding for an Aeropress for just myself takes about a minute... no big deal.  Sure you could use a drill to speed up the process but I got this to use while on travel, camping and in the mornings when I don't want to wake my wife.My only real complaint is that the grinder is slippery and you have to grip it pretty tight to keep it from spinning in your hand.  Other similar grinders on the market have a silicone sleeve which would likely help.  I added a grip tape, similar to what's used on skateboards or gun grips.  Not super pretty but makes a big difference, especially when grinding for espresso."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","This is easily my favorite Amazon purchase of the last 5 years. I was looking for a no fuss grinder that would allow me to enjoy fresh ground beans with my Aeropress and stumbled across this product. Even though it's not the usual ''name brand'' hand grinder that everyone recommends, I took a chance because I liked the look and construction of this unit. I have been beyond pleased with this grinder as it produces a consistent grind and is easy to adjust. Other reviewers mentioned the amount of time it takes to grind beans and I can confirm that it does take between 90-120s to grind coffee for on serving. However, it turns out that 120s is just about the time it takes for the Bonavita kettle to warm water so it's a great pairing. This is not the right grinder for people wanting to serve more than one cup of coffee at a time (the capacity is just too small). For the price, this is a great hand grinder that perfectly complements my Aeropress coffee ritual."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","I recently found a coffee that I loved,  it the company that was just putting it out only had it in beans.  I could've called and had them grind the beans but decided it's time to take my coffee to the next level and get a bean grinder.  Since it is my first, I wanted something simple and inexpensive in case I didn't like it.This grinder is pretty simple to use.  Put the beans in the top and turn the handle.  Since I have a Keurig and only brew one cup at a time, this was perfect.  Takes about a minute to grind the beans in this grinder and has multiple settings.  The canister for the grounds is perfect to pour into my reusable Keurig filter k-cup.  Multiple settings to change how fine you grind the beans.  If you are looking to grind more than enough beans for 2 cups might be a pain, but I have fallen in love of the process of grinding my beans fresh and then brewing my coffee.  You could probably grind beans for 4 cups maybe a little more but you'll be turning the handle for about a minute per cup.  I've been a coffee drinker for 25 years and when I used this with my newfound beans I love, it was by far the best coffee I have ever had.  This is also perfect for travel and considering taking this and my beans on an Alaskan cruise next month.  The thought of sitting on the deck watching the scenes of Alaska with the perfect cup of coffee is just paradise."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","I have been getting about the same variability in grind as with a simple electric blade grinder, which makes the product worthless to me. There is play in the burr assembly that allows it to become offset as soon as you begin grinding. After looking at the assembly, it's clear to me that there's no way to prevent this (the shaft is metal and the support is plastic). I'm having a hard time figuring out how so many people gave this product a good review, though plenty of people who gave three or four stars still complain of an uneven grind. I'm not going to add a couple stars to my review because the brushed steel looks pretty in my kitchen. Junk is junk."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","In buying a coffee grinder, I opted to go non-electric, as I may eventually move to another country where the voltage differs and US electrical appliances won't work.  Having done this before, I had to leave many items behind that I am now having to replace, having returned to the States.  This grinder, so far, works well, though I am still having to figure out the right coarseness for my French press.  The one downside is that it takes longer than the reviews stated to grind 4 Tablespoons of grounds needed for my morning pot.  Rather than the 2 minutes quoted, I found that it takes twice as long.  Since I am not much of a morning person until I've had some coffee, I have found it works best to grind the next mornings batch the night before.  Not the optimal arrangement, as the sooner the coffee is ground, it seems the fresher the coffee, but it is working for me.This grinder has a 2 year warranty, but then the directions state the burr grinding mechanism may be worn down and require replacement.  I have no idea how much that may cost.  My last electric grinder was going on 8 years old when I had to leave it behind in the States.  I am a bit disappointed to anticipate having to do this within a few years, and I hope that the price is reasonable to replace the burrs.The grinder is very compact and attractively designed.  I have some arthritis in my hands, but using this grinder has not put any undue stress or caused pain in my hands.  The grinder is easy to use; it just takes longer than I anticipated.  Overall, so far, I am satisfied with my purchase.  We'll see how I feel in 2 years, should I have to replace the burrs and find out their cost!"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","While it does take a little more time and effort to use, the results are worth it.  The grounds are consistent on a medium grind at 8-9 clicks, the more coarse the less consistent but that stands to reason.  For 1/3 cup of medium grounds, fill the bean reservoir and grind away.  It takes about 4 minutes to grind.  The crank handle seats well and turning is not difficult.  We bought this to go with theBodum Pour Over Coffee Maker  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LOCYKIQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1using low-acid Tres Hermanos organic coffee  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074FNDMJD/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1.  You will not be disappointed."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","This is a great grinder for your small batch coffee or for taking with you on the road. To set the grind, you have to start at ''0'' then work back to get it to the grind texture you want. I just set it in the middle, ground a little bit and checked then adjusted from there. Pretty simple. I would definitely recommend this. It's about the size of a home version of a pepper mill. Handle comes off at the top and is easily broken down for storage."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","The Javapresse coffee grinder is thoughtfully designed and manufactured in stainless steel and a plastic I could'nt identify (maybe more than one).  Unlike the motorized grinders, I expect a lifetime of service out of this grinder.  It was easy to get started with, and fits with our life-style very well - we generally aren't hurried and can enjoy the benefit of coffee ground on the spot, by hand, and brewed straightaway: exceptional flavor and aroma.  I would only caution that users might want to have a few grinds stored in a freezer for rushed mornings; also, musicians and others who risk repetitive motion injuries may want to be careful how they handle the Javapresse Manual as it could put your wrist in a disadvantageous orientation.  Don't get me wrong, I am glad to have it, it has been nothing but pleasure, I simply had to think about how to grip the body while grinding."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase.  I purchased the Java Press Maual Burr Grinder 6/16.  I wanted to replace my Krups electric blade gender and get a coarse grind for a French Press and Percolator.  I use several brands of Organic beans, from Costco, on-line sites and local roastersThe Java Press produces a nice coarse grind for my tastes and is simple to operate and easy to clean.  I clean every 2-3 weeks and  recommend using a bowl of warm soapy water to soak the parts, then rinse and dry on a paper towel.  Make certain you have both the black plastic and metal washers to bookend the spring and be careful around the sink.I have taken the grinder and my French Press trailer camping along with a good supply of bean.  Grind, brewand drink, no problem.  Also I take the the Java Press in my carry-on when flying - Not necessary to forego a great cup of coffee when you travel.Bedst part:  The company website is extremely helpful and Irene and Raj are available for email questions  They deeply care that we are satisfied customers and will go the distance to provide excellent servic.  When the black plastic insert in the reovable burr got cracked, I eamiled Irene at Java Press, a photo of the issue.  She was on it immediately and sent a replacement grinder with the newest burr that contains a nylon center suppot, an upgrade over plastic.  Her support was off the chart.The Java Press is a 5 star winner for a manual burr grinder and the customer service gets 10 Stars**  Java  Press is one of the best values at Amazon and will produce the grind you need to fine-tune a great cup of Joe.  I grind every morning and in a few minutes have fresh gound beanssteeping away.  Quality product + excellent support.  Go with it."
"4.0 out of 5 stars","I really love this coffee grinder. It feels solid, it's just the right size, and there's enough adjustment to get just the right grind. It looks amazing and I think it will last me a very long time. I'm glad I purchased this instead of a more expensive electric grinder; I was debating for quite some time prior to purchasing.The only thing I dislike about this grinder is that it constantly wants to fall apart at the middle where the two halves come together. You have to be sure to hold them both together while cranking the handle on top while grinding or the bottom half drops off and you lose all your freshly ground coffee. Seems like it should have been machined a little closer in tolerance so they held together more securely? Unsure if this is with all of them or if mine is defective."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","I've used the JavaPresse coffee grinder for a few weeks now.  I like the feel of it  when grinding coffee.  I use the AeroPress and like a more coarse grind so the adjustments make it great for that. I've found that filling the top portion full of coffee beans is the perfect amount to brew a single cup of coffee. Should have purchased this grinder a long time ago."
"3.0 out of 5 stars","The burr is able to pivot, creating a side that produces larger grind than the other. It also unscrews in the same direction as the crank. This results in the adjustable grind size to become larger as you rotate. This results in a final product that has a mixture of the fine grind one may be hoping for and large chunks. If you are getting this to make your ground coffee more evenly sized (something the motorized grinder has a hard time achieving) you may want to keep looking."
"4.0 out of 5 stars","The grinder arrived on time and as described.  I have used it only once, but so far, so good. It ground beans on course setting for French Press and they came out very good. I have not tried any other grind settings. The instructions give the recommended settings for multiple grind options. The setting knob for finest/courseness does not appear to have as many clicks to left/right as suggested { course setting 13-18 clicks ), more like 10-11 max. This does not hinder the performance on the grinder, however.  The handle just slips over the shaft on top, no screw down, This easy takedown is nice for storage as the crank arm is not sticking out.  You will be cranking for awhile, but the results speak for themselves and I recommend it.  4 stars, because time has not been a measurable factor yet and there is always something better to be discovered. Enjoy."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","I bought this grinder in the event of power outages, and secondarily for camping. It seems sturdy enough, and ground up a test batch of beans very nicely. The coarseness is easily adjustable, and can grind down to Turkish coffee fineness. As the seller's images show, it is slim, about the diameter of a paper towel core, so is easy for a small adult hand to grip. The handle slips on and off easily - it's not fastened - so it can be stored compactly.My only quibble is with the free coffee offer. Sure, it's not unreasonable for them to ask me to pay shipping, but I wanted to know how much that would be before committing to pay it. I didn't give them my card number, and aborted the process. I'd knock off a star for this, except the product is very nice."
"2.0 out of 5 stars","I like my coffee grinds on the finer side for uses with espresso and pour over coffee, and this grinder is just impractical for those applications. A fine grind takes way too long with a hand crank to yield 25 grams. I found myself cranking for more than 15 minutes just for a cup of coffee. I eventually just used a power drill instead of the hand crank to get the coffee a bit faster. For when I don't want to spend that time, I turn the setting to a coarser grind to make french press coffee.Pros:-portable-no power required-fairly consistent-inexpensiveCons:-no great clear frame of reference (like a number or guide) to tell you where the grind setting is (except by the number of threads on the screw cap)-inconvenient-material feels fragileIf you have the money to spend on an electric burr grinder, I'd suggest that."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","This manual grinder works great for grinding small amounts of coffee beans for 2 to 4 servings, depending on the chosen strength. It takes about 2 to 3 minutes to grind up a full container of beans at a weight of about 1 ounce.  The grain size is easily adjustable and once set you can leave it at that setting.  Would not recommend purchasing this manual grinder if one wants to grind a whole bag of beans, would be best to have it done at the store or purchase a suitable electric grinder. If one wants the freshest coffee which is what I wanted I grind about 1 oz of dark roast beans and mix with store bought ground coffee for added taste boost."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","If you come across this review, i will give you a tip here. You can get it for free by ordering a bag of coffee from the website. And the bag of coffee costs less than the price of the grinder you might pay for here. Also that free bag of coffee that this claim to give, you have to subscribe to a recurring subscription of coffee beans in order to get the first bag for free. The first free bag only ships out when the first payment for the subscription is charged.My main issue with this grinder is that, it is very hard to know what grind size you are currently on. You would first have to turn the knob all the way to the right, then turn left and count the number of clicks. I definitely did not expect this. I change the style of my coffee often, so each time i grind, i have to reset the grind size and adjust to the required number of clicks. I think this will cause unnecessary wear and tear each time you adjust the grind size. Why does this have so many reviews???"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","First impressions; this is a great coffee bean mill. Only downsides I can see so far is the capacity is rather small. 2 scoops fits fine but if making a lot of coffee it's going to take a few batches. Another thing that concerns me is the plastic mill inside. They did a nice job with all the stainless steel parts of this but skipped on the one that part that's going to be getting a beating. Why? I would've loved to see that part made of a stainless steel as well.I have this mill set up for my French press but I have to use an additional filter because the grounds are not uniform. I don't blame the mill per say but still not what I was expecting."
"4.0 out of 5 stars","You'll be most pleased with this grinder if you drink pour over or AeroPress or are using reusable K-cups for a Keurig-type machine and want to use fresh-roasted coffee.The freshness of the roast is THE most important factor in a good cup of coffee.  If your coffee is over 10 days old, you shouldn't really expect it to taste very good.  If the bag has a ''best used by'' date, I wouldn't buy it. You really want the bag to state the date the coffee was roasted. Not date shipped, not date packaged.  DATE ROASTED.  There's good reason to support your local or mail-order artisan coffee roaster, or to roast the beans yourself:  the coffee will taste SO MUCH BETTER.If you make espresso with this grinder it will be hit-and-miss, as very minor differences in granularity can have major effects on taste when making espresso. Different espresso roasts, different beans, and different degrees of freshness of roast all require very fine tweaking of the grind. Sometimes this JP grinder will be in the ''sweet spot'' for your roast and sometimes not.It takes 175-200 turns of the crank to produce a fine grind for one espresso. The burr diameter is very small, and that's what takess so many turns.  The hopper holds enough coffee beans for two updosed double espressos, or a small French Press.  It's fairly easy to refill. But if you're trying to make coffee for a foursome, or a couple of cups each for two people, a larger grinder would be better.The JavaPresse's granularity is inconsistent at its coarsest setting.I'd like to see a bigger version of the JavaPresse, one with the diameter of a SODA CAN,  and with a larger burr to match. A bearing reinforcement plate for the burr would be a good idea.  A larger model should produce a more consistent coarse grind for French Press while producing a fine grind too, and it should do so with fewer turns of the crank.If the larger model had the same fit and finish, and those enhancements, it would easily be worth twice the price."
"3.0 out of 5 stars","The grind on this conical burr is very good for my one cup French Press.  I'm not impressed with the metal housing/case - its thin metal and feels a little cheap.  With the hand crank attached, it is almost a little top heavy, but has a wide enough base to keep it from tipping over.  I wish it was a little heavier for weight balance while cranking/burring.  I use it for my one cup French Press and it churns out a great grind for the Press, but it is a little tiring grinding (forearm fatigue)  for one cup (it takes about 5 minutes).  if I was grinding for more than one cup I would use an electric grinder.  Despite the negative, this turns out a good grind for my French Press."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","So far, so good with this little grinder.  I'm using it with the Coffee Gator Pour Over Coffee Maker, 400ml/3-Cup, Standard.  Works like a charm.  However, if I were able to find a reasonably priced electric grinder that slowly and gently grinds beans, I would likely make the purchase since I can see this getting old somewhat quickly when the need for more than one cup is at hand.  That said, this is incredibly quiet, very easy to use, and it doesn't take long at all to grind when you are making just one cup. It's perfect for that function.See my review for the Gator on how to make an incredibly hot cup of coffee when you use chilled cream.If anyone has ideas on how to keep this clean, please leave a comment.  I use rather oily beans and assume over time this will cause some difficulties.01/17/2020 Never did find a good quality, conical electric grinder and still using this lovely little grinder. As it turns out, the oil in the bean helps keep the gear oiled so I'm the end, I wouldn't clean it anyway.Never had a jam. Never had a problem.Have zero complaints."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Have wanted a burr coffee grinder, but have not wanted to pay the expensive price. Have a Chemex coffee maker as well as a French press coffee maker and have wanted fresh ground coffee for them. I love the ritual of making an aromatic and delicious cup of coffee.came across the JavaPresse coffee grinder while researching pour over coffee products, read many of the reviews and decided to order one. It's easy to use and I'm going to strengthen my grip from holding the grinder while turning the handle. I'm still experimenting with the precise grind for me, but it works well, grinds smoothly and the videos online are helpful for cleaning the JavaPresse. So far so good. I'm happy with my little JavaPresse and would recommend it."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","This is the only hand grinder for coffee that I have ever used so take what I have to say with a grain of salt.It does a perfect job of grounding up coffee and maybe it is just me but the coffee I make now just taste better. It comes with basic instructions and a site to check out some videos for use/cleaning. So easy to use somewhat easy to clean. The one drawback is that it does take a long time to actually grind the coffee. My morning routine allows me to spend 5-7 minutes grinding my morning coffee but can see how that could be problematic for some. To grind for a group of three or more would be a time consuming process unless everyone really enjoyed grinding coffee. That said I didn't want to take any stars off because given 30 seconds of thought it should be obvious to this would be the case (obviously I did not have this thought). Anyway it's a great little coffee grinder I currently find myself using. Also I got a free bag of coffee which I have yet to try"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","First, I don't review something until it is thoroughly used.  I purchased this unit in May of 2018, about 20 months ago.  I use it nearly every day.  I had a rotator cuff tear and it was affecting my sleep.  The doctor at the Mayo gave me a piece of elastic band to help with exercises.  However, using this to both grind coffee and get some exercise helped.  In the early days, I would sometimes take my battery driven electric drill and attach it to where the crank goes, because a fine grain can take around 7 or so minutes doing the hand cranking.  My Porter Cable drill with the snap in lithium battery made short work of the grinding.  It does have an adjustment to set the grind size and for some beans the fine will clog the filter, so I move it about 1/2 turn.  The best news is that I'm pain free, sleep well and have full motion of my rotator cuff.  The doc said I might have to live with the pain into the foreseeable future, but no, that's not the case.My recommendation is do your body a favor and try this.  It's also good to know the company uses part of the proceeds to support worthy causes.  Hope this helps some-"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","Two issues...1) Uneven grind - I am getting an entire spectrum of grind sizes. Without any beans in it, brand new, I could hear the burr scraping one side. I can push it away from the side and it will stop but it should not have that much movement in the first place.2) Loose base - The base and main body are not very tight. I thought they would screw together but it just pulls apart. The connection is not that tight. Am I really expected to hold both parts at the same time with one hand while grinding with the other?"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","I have never had a bean grinder. I wanted to get some Death Wish Coffee to try and I figured if I got the whole beans and some re-usable Nespresso cups that I could make my own little espresso rockets to get me through the day.Pros, it works and it appears to work just fine. It's fully manual so it's a bit of a ritual chore, but some things are worth the journey so I'm not complaining about that at all.It doesn't appear to be super-easy to clean, though I have not attempted it just yet. I've been grinding the same beans and I can tap out most of the residual, but I'm sure I'm already getting some eye-rolls about needing to clear out any lingering oils and whatnot.The drawbacks are, the new owner registration is too happy for my tastes (I literally asked to NOT get any more emails during the signup, but I see there is more online content on their website than I would have thought for a manual coffee grinder). I will need to see how to clean this thing but I'm not looking forward to returning to their website.And, it's slightly expensive now that I had a look around and see what looks like the same exact device (so they OEM it, I assume) for less and even much less. Would I get the same results sans touchy-feeling customer experience and at a lower price?It's priced so that getting another one for grinding your flax seeds or other non-coffee dry goods would be completely reasonable, so maybe I could try that out and see how it goes.As is, though, it does precisely what I hoped it would and it appears to do it well."
"5.0 out of 5 stars","I bought a Cuisinart coffee grinder from Target a few months ago.  I'll admit I'm a coffee noob so I had no idea that my purchase was going to be a bad one. I figured Cuisinart makes some quality kitchen gadgets so they couldn't fail at something as simple as a coffee grinder right? Wrong! As this is not a review of the Cuisinart, I will tell you that his little hand grinder, although VERY slow, blew the more expensive electric contraption out of the water! The grind was more consistent and had no powder residue like its electric counterpart. My cups of Joe taste more consistent every morning and without all the funky sediment that the other machine left behind. The ONLY drawback thus far after a week of use is, I have to make coffee for both my wife and me and we drink A LOT! 5 cups between the both of us. Using a coffee formula on the internet, I found that I have to grind two and a half mills (around 66 grams) of coffee for our French press every single morning. This act roughly equates to an extra 20 mins just in coffee prep for me. Is it worth it? Hell yeah, it is! Now my little almost brand new Cuisinart sits on the counter unused, so if anyone wants to buy a cheap coffee grinder, hit me up! Seriously, buy this thing, it will change the way you make coffee."
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Takes much longer to grind than I expected, but does it well. Experimented with online recipes before I was going to take this camping, but ended up not taking this or the Aeropress on the trip. After seeing how long it was taking, I pulled an Alton Brown and ditched the included handle for my cordless drill! To get 15g of finely ground coffee, it took me a little over a minute with the drill. That's for one serving from the Aeropress after several other meticulous steps, including hitting a certain water temp. It was just more than I wanted to do first thing in the morning. May be worth it to you for single serve on a hike, but if tailgate camping; you don't want to be ''that guy'' everyone else in your group is watching while you crank away and they sip drip Folgers at the camp site... or then again, maybe you do."
"1.0 out of 5 stars","It's beautiful!The craftsmanship is also great.The design, however, is terrible. There are 2 fundamental issues with the design:1. Not enough grip on the body. You're expected to use 1 hand to grip the smooth cylindrical body (which is about 1.5'' in diameter) and prevent it from spinning while grinding with the handle.2. The plastic body, which is cylindrical, is glued to the stainless steel housing. There's a short dowel on the housing and a notch on the body that fit together to keep them from separating from each other. However, the plastic is soft, so of course with only a few uses, the notch is worn, causing the body to move a little and weaken the glue. Eventually the body and housing came apart. It's inevitable. Mind you, I was careful: set at coarse first then grind the coffee again at a finer setting. This should have helped relieve the strain.Cheers,DV"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Was not sure what to expect, so took a chance and bought.  My electric blade grinder broke, my electric mill or burr grinder is at work.  Very difficult to locate an inexpensive burr grinder locally so took to amazon because that is what we do now.  The manual idea was intriguing, picture looked nice.  Received, packaged excellent with plenty bubble wrap. No Scratch's on brushed steel. There are no threads for the top and bottom, it is a snug compression fit, slightly difficult to pull apart initially, once done no need to press together with much force.  Tried the fine grind first as that was how it shipped.  This took awhile and I was not sure it was working, so watch their video or loosen to half way between fine and course and you will be pleased. We are talking single cup brewing. No mess as with electric grinders, my number 1 reason,2 pours beautifully into single cup filter 3 no cord 4 sleek enough to leave out and I place near my salt and pepper grinders.  Highly recommended and makes for a great cup of Joe. Well done JavaPresse!"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","This product is supremely high quality, durable and versatile! I've been using it everyday! I have a keurig, nespresso, French press, and an espresso machine. I'm finding myself manually grinding my coffee every morning just so that I can make an aeropress cup of coffee! The flavor is so balanced, silky, and smooth! And even after the coffee gets cold, it still tastes good! If you prefer drinking lots of coffee, I would recommend an auto grinder for your fresh beans so that you can make multiple cups at a time. I'm really satisfied with this affordable product and I'm quite picky about my coffee. I purchase a lot from Amazon and rarely leave reviews, however, this product has truly impressed me and I like the email that was sent to me asking me how I liked my aeropress coffee maker. As a small family entrepreneur myself, I can definitely relate! Hopefully one day perhaps aeropress will let me help them sell their product internationally abroad, like Asia!I plan to take aeropress along with me to all of my travels! It's so convenient to do so in their complementary travel bag! No more bad coffee at hotels!"
